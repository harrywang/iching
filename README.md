I added pictures on trigrams, sequence chart, Chinese pinyin pronunciation, and Chinese-English translations from different sources. I also manually added the Chinese characters for the hexagrams and the index and formatted the main text using Markdown.

TODO: parse the text into sections and generate files in different formats, e.g., csv, json, excel, etc.
