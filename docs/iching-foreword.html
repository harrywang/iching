It also affords me a welcomeopportunity to pay tribute again to the memory of my late friend,Richard Wilhelm.  He himself was profoundly aware of the culturalsignificance of his translation of the <I>I Ching,</I> a versionunrivaled in the West.<P>If the meaning of the Book of Changes were easy to grasp, thework would need no foreword.  But this is far from being the case,for there is so much that is obscure about it that Western scholarshave tended to dispose of it as a collection of &quot;magic spells,&quot;either too abstruse to be intelligible, or of no value whatsoever.  Legge's translation of the <I>I Ching</I>, up to now the onlyversion available in English, has done little to make the workaccessible to Western minds.<A HREF="#1" NAME="X1"><SUP><FONT SIZE="1">[1]</FONT></SUP></A>Wilhelm, however, has made everyeffort to open the way to an understanding of the symbolism ofthe text.  He was in a position to do this because he himselfwas taught the philosophy and the use of the <I>I Ching</I> bythe venerable sage Lao Nai-hs&uuml;an; moreover, he had over aperiod of many years put the peculiar technique of the oracleinto practice.  His grasp of the living meaning of the text giveshis version of the <I>I Ching </I>a depth of perspective thatan exclusively academic knowledge of Chinese philosophy couldnever provide.<P>I am greatly indebted to Wilhelm for the light he has thrown uponthe complicated problem of the <I>I Ching</I>, and for insightas regards its practical application as well.  For more than thirtyyears I have interested myself in this oracle technique, or methodof exploring the unconscious, for it has seemed to me of uncommonsignificance.  I was already fairly familiar with the <I>I Ching</I>when I first met Wilhelm in the early nineteen twenties; he confirmedfor me then what I already knew, and taught me many things more.<P>I do not know Chinese and have never been in China.  I can assuremy reader that it is not altogether easy to find the right accessto this monument of Chinese thought, which departs so completelyfrom our ways of thinking.  In order to understand what such abook is all about, it is imperative to cast off certain prejudicesof the Western mind.  it is a curious fact that such a giftedand intelligent people as the Chinese has never developed whatwe call science.  Our science, however, is based upon the principleof causality, and causality is considered to be an axiomatic truth. But a great change in our standpoint is setting in.  What Kant's<I>Critique of Pure Reason </I>failed to do, is being accomplishedby modern physics.  The axioms of causality are being shaken totheir foundations: we know now that what we term natural lawsare merely statistical truths and thus must necessarily allowfor exceptions.  We have not sufficiently taken into account asyet that we need the laboratory with its incisive restrictionsin order to demonstrate the invariable validity of natural law. If we leave things to nature, we see a very different picture:every process is partially or totally interfered with by chance,so much so that under natural circumstances a course of eventsabsolutely conforming to specific laws is almost an exception.<P>The Chinese mind, as I see it at work in the <I>I Ching</I>, seemsto be exclusively preoccupied with the chance aspect of events. What we call coincidence seems to be the chief concern of thispeculiar mind, and what we worship as causality passes almostunnoticed.  We must admit that there is something to be said forthe immense importance of chance.  An incalculable amount of humaneffort is directed to combating and restricting the nuisance ordanger represented by chance.  Theoretical considerations of causeand effect often look pale and dusty in comparison to the practicalresults of chance.  It is all very well to say that the crystalof quartz is a hexagonal prism.  The statement is quite true inso far as an ideal crystal is envisaged.  But in nature one findsno two crystals exactly alike, although all are unmistakably hexagonal. The actual form, however, seems to appeal more to the Chinesesage than the ideal one.  The jumble of natural laws constitutingempirical reality holds more significance for him than a causalexplanation of events that, moreover, must usually be separatedfrom one another in order to be properly dealt with.<P>The manner in which the <I>I Ching</I> tends to look upon realityseems to disfavor our causalistic procedures.  The moment underactual observation appears to the ancient Chinese view more ofa chance hit than a clearly defined result of concurring causalchain processes.  The matter of interest seems to be the configurationformed by chance events in the moment of observation, and notat all the hypothetical reasons that seemingly account for thecoincidence. While the Western mind carefully sifts, weighs, selects,classifies, isolates, the Chinese picture of the moment encompasseseverything down to the minutest nonsensical detail, because allof the ingredients make up the observed moment.<P>Thus it happens that when one throws the three coins, or countsthrough the forty-nine yarrow stalks, these chance details enterinto the picture of the moment of observation and form a partof it -- a part that is insiguificant to us, yet most meaningfulto the Chinese mind.  With us it would be a banal and almost meaninglessstatement (at least on the face of it) to say that whatever happensin a given moment possesses inevitably the quality peculiar tothat moment.  This is not an abstract argument but a very practicalone.  There are certain connoisseurs who can tell you merely fromthe appearance, taste, and behavior of a wine the site of itsvineyard and the year of its origin. There are antiquarians whowith almost uncanny accuracy will name the time and place of originand the maker of an <I>objet d'art</I> or piece of furniture onmerely looking at it.  And there are even astrologers who cantell you, without any previous knowledge of your nativity, whatthe position of sun and moon was and what zodiacal sign rose abovethe horizon in the moment of your birth.  In the face of suchfacts, it must be admitted that moments can leave long-lastingtraces.<P>In other words, whoever invented the <I>I Ching</I> was convincedthat the hexagram worked out in a certain moment coincided withthe latter in quality no less than in time.  To him the hexagramwas the exponent of the moment in which it was cast -- even moreso than the hours of the clock or the divisions of the calendarcould be -- inasmuch as the hexagram was understood to be an indicatorof the essential situation prevailing in the moment of its origin.<P>This assumption involves a certain curious principle that I havetermed synchronicity,<A HREF="#2" NAME="X2"><SUP><FONT SIZE="1">[2]</FONT></SUP></A> a concept that formulates a pointof view diametrically opposed to that of causality.  Since thelatter is a merely statistical truth and not absolute, it is asort of working hypothesis of how events evolve one out of another,whereas synchronicity takes the coincidence of events in spaceand time as meaning something more than mere chance, namely, apeculiar interdependence of objective events among themselvesas well as with the subjective (psychic) states of the observeror observers.<P>The ancient Chinese mind contemplates the cosmos in a way comparableto that of the modern physicist, who cannot deny that his modelof the world is a decidedly psychophysical structure. The microphysicalevent includes the observer just as much as the reality underlyingthe <I>I Ching</I> comprises subjective, i.e., psychic conditionsin the totality of the momentary situation. Just as causalitydescribes the sequence of events, so synchronicity to the Chinesemind deals with the coincidence of events.  The causal point ofview tells us a dramatic story about how <I>D</I> came into existence:it took its origin from <I>C</I>, which existed before <I>D</I>,and <I>C</I> in its turn had a father, <I>B</I>, etc. The synchronisticview on the other hand tries to produce an equally meaningfulpicture of coincidence.  How does it happen that <I>A', B', C',D'</I>, etc., appear all in the same moment and in the same place?It happens in the first place because the physical events <I>A'</I>and <I>B'</I> are of the same quality as the psychic events <I>C'</I>and <I>D'</I>, and further because all are the exponents of oneand the same momentary situation.  The situation is assumed torepresent a legible or understandable picture.<P>Now the sixty-four hexagrams of the <I>I Ching</I> are the instrumentby which the meaning of sixty-four different yet typical situationscan be determined.  These interpretations are equivalent to causalexplanations.  Causal connection is statistically necessary andcan therefore be subjected to experiment.  Inasmuch as situationsare unique and cannot be repeated, experimenting with synchronicityseems to be impossible under ordinary conditions.<A HREF="#3" NAME="X3"><SUP><FONT SIZE="1">[3]</FONT></SUP></A>  In the <I>IChing</I>, the only criterion of the validity of synchronicityis the observer's opinion that the text of the hexagram amountsto a true rendering of his psychic condition.  It is assumed thatthe fall of the coins or the result of the division of the bundleof yarrow stalks is what it necessarily must be in a given &quot;situation,&quot;inasmuch as anything happening in that moment belongs to it asan indispensable part of the picture.  If a handful of matchesis thrown to the floor, they form the pattern characteristic ofthat moment.  But such an obvious truth as this reveals its meaningfulnature only if it is possible to read the pattern and to verifyits interpretation, partly by the observer's knowledge of thesubjective and objective situation, partly by the character ofsubsequent events.  It is obviously not a procedure that appealsto a critical mind used to experimental verification of factsor to factual evidence.  But for someone who likes to look atthe world at the angle from which ancient China saw it, the <I>IChing</I> may have some attraction.<P>My argument as outlined above has of course never entered a Chinesemind.  On the contrary, according to the old tradition, it is &quot;spiritualagencies,&quot; acting in a mysterious way, that make the yarrowstalks give a meaningful answer.<A HREF="#4" NAME="X4"><SUP><FONT SIZE="1">[4]</FONT></SUP></A>  These powers form, as itwere, the living soul of the book.  As the latter is thus a sortof animated being, the tradition assumes that one can put questionsto the <I>I Ching</I> and expect to receive intelligent answers. Thus it occurred to me that it might interest the uninitiatedreader to see the I <I>Ching</I> at work.  For this purpose Imade an experiment strictly in accordance with the Chinese conception:I personified the book in a sense, asking its judgment about itspresent situation, i.e., my intention to present it to the Westernmind.<P>Although this procedure is well within the premises of Taoistphilosophy, it appears exceedingly odd to us.  However, not eventhe strangeness of insane delusions or of primitive superstitionhas ever shocked me.  I have always tried to remain unbiased andcurious -- <I>rerum novarum cupidus</I>.  Why not venture a dialoguewith an ancient book that purports to be animated?  There canbe no harm in it, and the reader may watch a psychological procedurethat has been carried out time and again throughout the millenniaof Chinese civilization, representing to a Confucius or a Lao-tseboth a supreme expression of spiritual authority and a philosophicalenigma. I made use of the coin method, and the answer obtainedwas hexagram 50, Ting, THE CALDRON.<P>In accordance with the way my question was phrased, the text ofthe hexagram must be regarded as though the <I>I Ching</I> itselfwere the speaking person.  Thus it describes itself as a caldron,that is, as a ritual vessel containing cooked food.  Here thefood is to be understood as spiritual nourishment.  Wilhelm saysabout this:<BLOCKQUOTE>The ting, as a utensil pertaining to a refined civilization, suggeststhe fostering and nourishing of able men, which redounded to thebenefit of the state. . . .  Here we see civilization as it reachesits culmination in religion.  The <I>ting </I>serves in offeringsacrifice to God. . . . The supreme revelation of God appearsin prophets and holy men.  To venerate them is true venerationof God.  The will of God, as revealed through them, should beaccepted in humility.</BLOCKQUOTE>Keeping to our hypothesis, we must conclude that the <I>I Ching</I>is here testifying concerning itself.<P>When any of the lines of a given hexagram have the value of sixor nine, it means that they are specially emphasized and henceimportant in the interpretation.<A HREF="#5" NAME="X5"><SUP><FONT SIZE="1">[5]</FONT></SUP></A>  In my hexagram the &quot;spiritualagencies&quot; have given the emphasis of a nine to the linesin the second and in the third place.  The text says:<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="6" CELLPADDING="12"><TR> <TD>Nine in the second place means:<BR>There is food in the <I>ting</I>.<BR>My comrades are envious,<BR>But they cannot harm me.<BR>Good fortune. </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>Thus the <I>I Ching</I> says of itself: &quot;I contain (spiritual)nourishment.&quot;  Since a share in something great always arousesenvy, the chorus of the envious<A HREF="#6" NAME="X6"><SUP><FONT SIZE="1">[6]</FONT></SUP></A> is part of the picture.  Theenvious want to rob the <I>I Ching</I> of its great possession,that is, they seek to rob it of meaning, or to destroy its meaning.But their enmity is in vain. Its richness of meaning is assured;that is, it is convinced of its positive achievements, which noone can take away.  The text continues:<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="6" CELLPADDING="12"><TR> <TD>Nine in the third place means:<BR>The handle of the <I>ting</I> is altered.<BR>One is impeded in his way of life.<BR>The fat of the pheasant is not eaten.<BR>Once rain falls, remorse is spent.<BR>Good fortune comes in the end. </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>The handle [German <I>Griff</I>] is the part by which the <I>ting</I>can be grasped [<I>gegriffen</I>].  Thus it signifies theconcept<A HREF="#7" NAME="X7"><SUP><FONT SIZE="1">[7]</FONT></SUP></A> (<I>Begriff</I>) one has of the <I>I Ching</I> (the<I>ting</I>).  In the course of time this concept has apparentlychanged, so that today we can no longer grasp (<I>begreifen</I>)the <I>I Ching</I>. Thus &quot;one is impeded in his way of life.&quot; We are no longer supported by the wise counsel and deep insightof the oracle; therefore we no longer find our way through themazes of fate and the obscurities of our own natures. The fat ofthe pheasant, that is, the best and richest part of a good dish,is no longer eaten.  But when the thirsty earth finally receivesrain again, that is, when this state of want has been overcome,&quot;remorse,&quot; that is, sorrow over the loss of wisdom, isended, and then comes the longed-for opportunity. Wilhelmcomments: &quot;This describes a man who, in a highly evolved civilization,finds himself in a place where no one notices or recognizeshim. This is a severe block to his effectiveness.&quot;  The <I>I Ching</I>is complaining, as it were, that its excellent qualitiesgo unrecognized and hence lie fallow. It comforts itself withthe hope that it is about to regain recognition.<P>The answer given in these two salient lines to the question Iput to the <I>I Ching</I> requires no particular subtlety of interpretation,no artifices, no unusual knowledge.  Anyone with a little commonsense can understand the meaning of the answer; it is the answerof one who has a good opinion of himself, but whose value is neithergenerally recognized nor even widely known.  The answering subjecthas an interesting notion of itself: it looks upon itself as avessel in which sacrificial offerings are brought to the gods,ritual food for their nourishment.  It conceives of itself asa cult utensil serving to provide spiritual nourishment for theunconscious elements or forces (&quot;spiritual agencies&quot;)that have been projected as gods -- in other words, to give theseforces the attention they need in order to play their part inthe life of the individual.  Indeed, this is the original meaningof the word <I>religio</I> - a careful observation and takingaccount of (from <I>relegere</I> <A HREF="#8" NAME="X8"><SUP><FONT SIZE="1">[8]</FONT></SUP></A>) the numinous.<P>The method of the <I>I Ching </I>does indeed take into accountthe hidden individual quality in things and men, and in one'sown unconscious self as well.  I have questioned the <I>I Ching</I>as one questions a person whom one is about to introduce to friends:one asks whether or not it will be agreeable to him.  In answerthe <I>I Ching</I> tells me of its religious significance, ofthe fact that at present it is unknown and misjudged, of its hopeof being restored to a place of honor -- this last obviously witha sidelong glance at my as yet unwritten foreword,<A HREF="#9" NAME="X9"><SUP><FONT SIZE="1">[9]</FONT></SUP></A> and aboveall at the English translation. This seems a perfectly understandablereaction, such as one could expect also from a person in a similarsituation.<P>But how has this reaction come about? Because I threw three smallcoins into the air and let them fall, roll, and come to rest,heads up or tails up as the case might be.  This odd fact thata reaction that makes sense arises out of a technique seeminglyexcluding all sense from the outset, is the great achievementof the <I>I Ching</I>.  The instance I have just given is notunique; meaningful answers are the rule.  Western sinologues anddistinguished Chinese scholars have been at pains to inform methat the <I>I Ching</I> is a collection of obsolete &quot;magicspells.&quot;  In the course of these conversations my informanthas sometimes admitted having consulted the oracle through a fortuneteller, usually a Taoist priest.  This could be &quot;only nonsense&quot;of course.  But oddly enough, the answer received apparently coincidedwith the questioner's psychological blind spot remarkably well.<P>I agree with Western thinking that any number of answers to myquestion were possible, and I certainly cannot assert that anotheranswer would not have been equally significant.  However, theanswer received was the first and only one; we know nothing ofother possible answers.  It pleased and satisfied me.  To askthe same question a second time would have been tactless and soI did not do it: &quot;the master speaks but once.&quot;  Theheavy-handed pedagogic approach that attempts to fit irrationalphenomena into a preconceived rational pattern is anathema tome.  Indeed, such things as this answer should remain as theywere when they first emerged to view, for only then do we knowwhat nature does when left to herself undisturbed by the meddlesomenessof man.  One ought not to go to cadavers to study life. Moreover,a repetition of the experiment is impossible, for the simple reasonthat the original situation cannot be reconstructed.  Thereforein each instance there is only a first and single answer.<P>To return to the hexagram itself.  There is nothing strange inthe fact that all of Ting, THE CALDRON, amplifies the themes announcedby the two salient lines.<A HREF="#10" NAME="X10"><SUP><FONT SIZE="1">[10]</FONT></SUP></A>  The first line of the hexagramsays:<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="6" CELLPADDING="12"><TR> <TD>A <I>ting</I> with legs upturned.<BR>Furthers removal of stagnating stuff.<BR>One takes a concubine for the sake of her son.<BR>No blame. </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>A <I>ting</I> that is turned upside down is not in use.  Hencethe <I>I Ching</I> is like an unused caldron.  Turning it overserves to remove stagnating matter, as the line says. Just asa man takes a concubine when his wife has no son, so the <I>IChing</I> is called upon when one sees no other way out.  Despitethe quasi-legal status of the concubine in China, she is in realityonly a somewhat awkward makeshift so likewise the magic procedureof the oracle is an expedient that may be utilized for a higherpurpose.  There is no blame, although it is an exceptional recourse.<P>The second and third lines have already been discussed.  The fourthline says:<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="6" CELLPADDING="12"><TR> <TD>The legs of the <I>ting</I> are broken.<BR>The prince's meal is spilled<BR>And his person is soiled.<BR>Misfortune.<BR> </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>Here the <I>ting </I>has been put to use, but evidently in a veryclumsy manner, that is, the oracle has been abused or misinterpreted.  Inthis way the divine food is lost, and one puts oneself toshame.  Legge translates as follows: &quot;Its subject will bemade to blush for shame.&quot;  Abuse of a cult utensil such asthe <I>ting </I>(i.e., the <I>I Ching</I>) is a gross profanation.  The<I>I Ching</I> is evidently insisting here on its dignityas a ritual vessel and protesting against being profanely used.<P>The fifth line says:<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="6" CELLPADDING="12"><TR> <TD>The <I>ting</I> has yellow handles, golden carrying rings.<BR>Perseverance furthers. </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>The <I>I Ching</I> has, it seems, met with a new, correct (yellow)understanding, that is, a new concept (<I>Begriff</I>)<I> </I>bywhich it can be grasped.  This concept is valuable (golden).There is indeed a new edition in English, making the book moreaccessible to the Western world than before.<P>The sixth line says:<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="6" CELLPADDING="12"><TR> <TD>The <I>ting</I> has rings of jade.<BR>Great good fortune.<BR>Nothing that would not act to further. </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>Jade is distinguished for its beauty and soft sheen.  If the carryingrings are of jade, the whole vessel is enhanced in beauty, honor,and value.  The <I>I Ching</I> expresses itself here as beingnot only well satisfied but indeed very optimistic.  One can onlyawait further events and in the meantime remain content with thepleasant conclusion that the <I>I Ching</I> approves of the newedition.<P>I have shown in this example as objectively as I can how the oracleproceeds in a given case.  Of course the procedure varies somewhataccording to the way the question is put.  If for instance a personfinds himself in a confusing situation, he may himself appearin the oracle as the speaker.  Or, if the question concerns arelationship with another person, that person may appear as thespeaker.  However, the identity of the speaker does not dependentirely on the manner in which the question is phrased, inasmuchas our relations with our fellow beings are not always determinedby the latter.  Very often our relations depend almost exclusivelyon our own attitudes, though we maybe quite unaware of this fact. Hence, if an individual is unconscious of his role in a relationship,there may be a surprise in store for him; contrary to expectation,he himself may appear as the chief agent, as is sometimes unmistakablyindicated by the text.  It may also occur that we take a situationtoo seriously and consider it extremely important, whereas theanswer we get on consulting the <I>I Ching</I> draws attentionto some unsuspected other aspect impllcit in the question.<P>Such instances might at first lead one to think that the oracleis fallacious. Confucius is said to have received only one inappropriateanswer, i.e., hexagram 22, GRACE -- a thoroughly aesthetic hexagram.This is reminiscent of the advice given to Socrates by his daemon-- &quot;You ought to make more music&quot; -- whereupon Socratestook to playing the flute.  Confucius and Socrates compete forfirst place as far as reasonableness and a pedagogic attitudeto life are concerned; but it is unlikely that either of themoccupied himself with &quot;lending grace to the beard on hischin,&quot; as the second line of this hexagram advises.  Unfortunately,reason and pedagogy often lack charm and grace, and so the oraclemay not have been wrong after all.<P>To come back once more to our hexagram.  Though the <I>I Ching</I>not only seems to be satisfied with its new edition, but evenexpresses emphatic optimism, this still does not foretell anythingabout the effect it will have on the public it is intended toreach.  Since we have in our hexagram two yang lines stressedby the numerical value nine, we are in a position to find outwhat sort of prognosis the <I>I Ching</I> makes for itself.  Linesdesignated by a six or a nine have, according to the ancient conception,an inner tension so great as to cause them to change into theiropposites, that is, yang into yin, and vice versa.  Through thischange we obtain in the present instance hexagram 55, Chin, PROGRESS.<P>The subject of this hexagram is someone who meets with all sortsof vicissitudes of fortune in his climb upward, and the text describeshow he should hehave.  The <I>I Ching </I>is in this same situation:it rises like the sun and declares itself, but it is rebuffedand finds no confidence -- it is &quot;progressing, but in sorrow.&quot; However, &quot;one obtains great happiness from one's ancestress.&quot; Psychology can help us to elucidate this obscure passage.  Indreams and fairy tales the grandmother, or ancestress, often representsthe unconscious, because the latter in a man contains the femininecomponent of the psyche.  If the <I>I Ching</I> is not acceptedby the conscious, at least the unconscious meets it halfway, andthe <I>I Ching</I> is more closely connected with the unconsciousthan with the rational attitude of consciousness.  Since the unconsciousis often represented in dreams by a feminine figure, this maybe the explanation here.  The feminine person might be the translator,who has given the book her maternal care, and this might easilyappear to the <I>I Ching</I> as a &quot;great happiness.&quot; It anticipates general understantling, but is afraid of misuse-- &quot;Progress like a hamster.&quot;  But it is mindful ofthe admonition, &quot;Take not gain and loss to heart.&quot;It remains free of &quot;partisan motives.&quot;  It does notthrust itself on anyone.<P>The <I>I Ching</I> therefore faces its future on the Americanbook market calmly and expresses itself here just about as anyreasonable person would in regard to the fate of so controversiala work.  This prediction is so very reasonable and full of commonsense that it would be hard to think of a more fitting answer.<P>All of this happened before I had written the foregoing paragraphs. When I reached this point, I wished to know the attitude of the<I>I Ching</I> to the new situation.  The state of things hadbeen altered by what I had written, inasmuch as I myself had nowentered upon the scene, and I therefore expected to hear somethingreferring to my own action.  I must confess that I had not beenfeeling too happy in the course of writing this foreword, for,as a person with a sense of responsibility toward science, I amnot in the habit of asserting something I cannot prove or at leastpresent as acceptable to reason. It is a dubious task indeed totry to introduce to a critical modern public a collection of archaic&quot;magic spells,&quot; with the idea of making them more orless acceptable.  I have undertaken it because I myself thinkthat there is more to the ancient Chinese way of thinking thanmeets the eye.  But it is embarrassing to me that I must appealto the good will and imagination of the reader, inasmuch as Ihave to take him into the obscurity of an age-old magic ritual. Unfortunately I am only too well aware of the arguments thatcan be brought against it.  We are not even certain that the shipthat is to carry us over the unknown seas has not sprung a leaksomewhere.  May not the old text be corrupt?  Is Wilhelm's translationaccurate? Are we not self-deluded in our explanations?<P>The <I>I Ching</I> insists upon self-knowledge throughout.  Themethod by which this is to be achieved is open to every kind ofmisuse, and is therefore not for the frivolous-minded and immature;nor is it for intellectualists and rationalists.  It is appropriateonly for thoughtful and reflective people who like to think aboutwhat they do and what happens to them -- a predilection not tobe confused with the morbid brooding of the hypochondriac.  AsI have indicated above, I have no answer to the multitude of problemsthat arise when we seek to harmonize the oracle of the <I>I Ching</I>with our accepted scientific canons.  But needless to say, nothing&quot;occult&quot; is to be inferred.  My position in these mattersis pragmatic, and the great disciplines that have taught me thepractical usefulness of this viewpoint are psychotherapy and medicalpsychology.  Probably in no other field do we have to reckon withso many unknown quantities, and nowhere else do we become moreaccustomed to adopting methods that work even though for a longtime we may not know why they work.  Unexpected cures may arisefrom questionable therapies and unexpected failures from allegedlyreliable methods.  In the exploration of the unconscious we comeupon very strange things, from which a rationalist turns awaywith horror, claiming afterward that he did not see anything. The irrational fullness of life has taught me never to discardanything, even when it goes against all our theories (so short-livedat best) or otherwise admits of no immediate explanation.  Itis of course disquieting, and one is not certain whether the compassis pointing true or not; but security, certitude, and peace donot lead to discoveries.  It is the same with this Chinese modeof divination.  Clearly the method aims at self-knowledge, thoughat all times it has also been put to superstitious use.<P>I of course am thoroughly convinced of the value of self-knowledge,but is there any use in recommending such insight, when the wisestof men throughout the ages have preached the need of it withoutsuccess? Even to the most biased eye it is obvious that this bookrepresents one long admonition to careful scrutiny of one's owncharacter, attitude, and motives.  This attitude appeals to meand has induced me to undertake the foreword.  Only once beforehave I expressed myself in regard to the problem of the <I>I Ching</I>:this was in a memorial address in tribute to Richard Willielm.<A HREF="#11" NAME="X11"><SUP><FONT SIZE="1">[11]</FONT></SUP></A>For the rest I have maintained a discreet silence.  It is by nomeans easy<P>to feel one's way into such a remote and mysterious mentalityas that underlying the <I>I Ching</I>.  One cannot easily disregardsuch great minds as Confucius and Lao-tse, if one is at all ableto appreciate the quality of the thoughts they represent; muchless can one overlook the fact that the <I>I Ching</I> was theirmain source of inspiration.  I know that previously I would nothave dared to express myself so explicitly about so uncertaina matter.  I can take this risk because I am now in my eighthdecade, and the changing opinions of men scarcely impress me anymore; the thoughts of the old masters are of greater value tome than the philosophical prejudices of the Western mind.<P>I do not like to burden my reader with these personal considerations;but, as already indicated, one's own personality is very oftenimplicated in the answer of the oracle.  Indeed, in formulatingmy question I even invited the oracle to comment directly on myaction.  The answer was hexagram 29, K'an, THE ABYSMAL.  Specialemphasis is given to the third place by the fact that the lineis designated by a six. This line says:<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="6" CELLPADDING="12"><TR> <TD>Forward and backward, abyss on abyss.<BR>In danger like this, pause at first and wait,<BR>Otherwise you will fall into a pit in the abyss.<BR>Do not act in this way. </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>Formerly I would have accepted unconditionally the advice, &quot;Donot act in this way,&quot; and would have refused to give my opinionof the <I>I Ching</I>, for the sole reason that I had none.  Butnow the counsel may serve as an example of the way in which the<I>I Ching</I> functions.  It is a fact that if one begins tothink about it, the problems of the <I>I Ching</I> do represent&quot;abyss on abyss,&quot; and unavoidably one must &quot;pauseat first and wait&quot; in the midst of the dangers of limitlessand uncritical speculation; otherwise one really will lose hisway in the darkness.  Could there be a more uncomfortable positionintellectually than that of floating in the thin air of unprovedpossibilities, not knowing whether what one sees is truth or illusion?This is the dreamlike atmosphere of the <I>I Ching</I>, and init one has nothing to rely upon except one's own so fallible subjectivejudgment.  I cannot but admit that this line represents very appropriatelythe feelings with which I wrote the foregoing passages.  Equallyfitting is the comforting beginning of this hexagram -- &quot;Ifyou are sincere, you have success in your heart&quot; -- for itindicates that the decisive thing here is not the outer dangerbut the subjective condition, that is, whether one believes oneselfto be &quot;sincere&quot; or not.<P>The hexagram compares the dynamic action in this situation tothe behavior of flowing water, which is not afraid of any dangerousplace but plunges over cliffs and fills up the pits that lie inits course (K'an also stands for water).  This is the way in whichthe &quot;superior man&quot; acts and &quot;carries on the businessof teaching.&quot;<P>K'an is definitely one of the less agreeable hexagrams.  It describesa situation in which the subject seems in grave danger of beingcaught in all sorts of pitfalls.  Just as in interpreting a dreamone must follow the dream text with utmost exactitude, so in consultingthe oracle one must hold in mind the form of the question put,for this sets a definite limit to the interpretation of the answer. The first line of the hexagram notes the presence of the danger:&quot;In the abyss one falls into a pit.&quot;  The second linedoes the same, then adds the counsel: &quot;One should striveto attain small things only.&quot;  I apparently anticipated thisadvice by limiting myself in this foreword to a demonstrationof how the <I>I Ching</I> functions in the Chinese mind, and byrenouncing the more ambitious project of writing a psychologicalcommentary on the whole book.<P>The fourth line says:<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="6" CELLPADDING="12"><TR> <TD>A jug of wine, a bowl of rice with it;<BR>Earthen vessels<BR>Simply handed in through the window.<BR>There is certainly no blame in this. </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>Wilhelm makes the following comment here:<BLOCKQUOTE>Although as a rule it is customary for an official to presentcertain introductory gifts and recommendations before he is appointed,here everything is simplified to the utmost.  The gifts are insignificant,there is no one to sponsor him, he introduces himself; yet allthis need not be humiliating if only there is the honest intentionof mutual help in danger.</BLOCKQUOTE>Wilhelm makes the following comment here:<P>Although as a rule it is customary for an official to presentcertain introductory gifts and recommendations before he is appointed,here everything is simplified to the utmost.  The gifts are insignificant,there is no one to sponsor him, he introduces himself; yet allthis need not be humiliating if only there is the honest intentionof mutual help in danger.<P>It looks as if the book were to some degree the subject of thisline.<P>The fifth line continues the theme of limitation.  If one studiesthe nature of water, one sees that it fills a pit only to therim and then flows on.  It does not stay caught there:<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="6" CELLPADDING="12"><TR> <TD>The abyss is not filled to overflowing,<BR>It is filled only to the rim. </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>But if, tempted by the danger, and just because of the uncertainty,one were to insist on forcing conviction by special efforts, suchas elaborate commentaries and the like, one would only be miredin the difficulty, which the top line describes very accuratelyas a tied-up and caged-in condition. Indeed, the last line oftenshows the consequences that result when one does not take themeaning of the hexagram to heart.<P>In our hexagram we have a six in the third place. This yin lineof mounting tension changes into a yang line and thus producesa new hexagram showing a new possibility or tendency.  We nowhave hexagram 48, Ching, THE WELL.  The water hole no longer meansdanger, however, but rather something beneficial, a well:<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="6" CELLPADDING="12"><TR> <TD>Thus the superior man encourages the people attheir work,<BR>And exhorts them to help one another. </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>The image of people helping one another would seem to refer tothe reconstruction of the well, for it is broken down and fullof mud.  Not even animals drink from it.  There are fishes livingin it, and one can shoot these, but the well is not used for drinking,that is, for human needs.  This description is reminiscent ofthe overturned and unused <I>ting</I> that is to receive a newhandle.  Moreover, this well, like the <I>ting</I>, is cleaned. But no one drinks from it:<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER="6" CELLPADDING="12"><TR> <TD>This is my heart's sorrow,<BR>For one might draw from it. </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P>The dangerous water hole or abyss pointed to the <I>I Ching</I>,and so does the well, but the latter has a positive meaning: itcontains the waters of life.  It should he restored to use.  Butone has no concept (<I>Begriff</I>) of it, no utensil with whichto carry the water; the jug is broken and leaks.  The <I>ting</I>needs new handles and carrying rings by which to grasp it, andso also the well must be newly lined, for it contains &quot;aclear, cold spring from which one can drink.&quot;  One may drawwater from it, because &quot;it is dependable.&quot;<P>It is clear that in this prognosis the speaking subject is againthe <I>I Ching</I>, representing itself as a spring of livingwater.  The preceding hexagram described in detail the dangerconfronting the person who accidentally falls into the pit withinthe abyss.  He must work his way out of it, in order to discoverthat it is an old, ruined well, buried in mud, but capable ofbeing restored to use again.<P>I submitted two questions to the method of chance representedby the coin oracle, the second question being put after I hadwritten my analysis of the answer to the first.  The first questionwas directed, as it were, to the <I>I Ching</I>:  what had itto say about my intention to write a foreword? The second questionconcerned my own action, or rather the situation in which I wasthe acting subject who had discussed the first hexagram.  To thefirst question the <I>I Ching</I> replied by comparing itselfto a caldron, a ritual vessel in need of renovation, a vesselthat was finding only doubtful favor with the public.  To thesecond question the reply was that I had fallen into a difficulty,for the <I>I Ching</I> represented a deep and dangerous waterhole in which one might easily be mired.  However, the water holeproved to be an old well that needed only to be renovated in orderto be put to useful purposes once more.<P>These four hexagrams are in the main consistent as regards theme(vessel, pit, well); and as regards intellectual content theyseem to be meaningful.  Had a human being made such replies, Ishould, as a psychiatrist, have had to pronounce him of soundmind, at least on the basis of the material presented. Indeed,I should not have been able to discover anything delirious, idiotic,or schizophrenic in the four answers.  In view of the <I>I Ching</I>'sextreme age and its Chinese origin, I cannot consider its archaic,symbolic, and flowery language abnormal.  On the contrary, I shouldhave had to congratulate this hypothetical person on the extentof his insight into my unexpressed state of doubt.  On the otherhand, any person of clever and versatile mind can turn the wholething around and show how I have projected my subjective contentsinto the symbolism of the hexagrams.  Such a critique, thoughcatastrophic from the standpoint of Western rationality, doesno harm to the function of the <I>I Ching</I>. On the contrary,the Chinese sage would smilingly tell me: &quot;Don't you seehow useful the <I>I Ching</I> is in making you project your hithertounrealized thoughts into its abstruse symbolism? You could havewritten your foreword without ever realizing what an avalancheof misunderstanding might be released by it.&quot;<P>The Chinese standpoint does not concern itself as to the attitudeone takes toward the performance of the oracle.  It is only wewho are puzzled, because we trip time and again over our prejudice,viz., the notion of causality.  The ancient wisdom of the Eastlays stress upon the fact that the intelligent individual realizeshis own thoughts, but not in the least upon the way in which hedoes it.  The less one thinks about the theory of the <I>I Ching</I>,the more soundly one sleeps.<P>It would seem to me that on the basis of this example an unprejudicedreader would now be in a position to form at least a tentativejudgment on the operation of the <I>I Ching</I>.<A HREF="#12" NAME="X12"><SUP><FONT SIZE="1">[12]</FONT></SUP></A> More cannotbe expected from a simple introduction.  If by means of this demonstrationI have succeeded in elucidating the psychological phenomenologyof the <I>I Ching</I>, I shall have carried out my purpose.  Asto the thousands of questions, doubts, and criticisms that thissingular book stirs up -- I cannot answer these.  The <I>I Ching</I>does not offer itself with proofs and results; it does not vauntitself, nor is it easy to approach.  Like a part of nature, itwaits until it is discovered.  It offers neither facts nor power,but for lovers of self-knowledge, of wisdom -- if there be such-- it seems to be the right book.  To one person its spirit appearsas clear as day; to another, shadowy as twilight; to a third,dark as night.  He who is not pleased by it does not have to useit, and he who is against it is not obliged to find it true.Let it go forth into the world for the benefit of those who candiscern its meaning.<BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN="right">C.
